Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position. With a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and over two years of professional experience in software development, I bring a comprehensive understanding of both backend and frontend technologies, along with a passion for creating efficient and scalable solutions.

During my time at **CI&T** and **Pagbank**, I had the opportunity to work extensively with Java and Kotlin in microservices architectures using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Kafka. I also contributed to system observability using tools such as DataDog and Prometheus, and maintained code quality through SonarQube. These experiences taught me the importance of clean architecture, robust testing, and clear communication in a collaborative, agile environment.

In addition to my backend experience, I‚Äôve worked on web development projects using React, JavaScript, and Node.js. I‚Äôve also experimented with blockchain solutions using Corda 5, giving me a broad perspective on modern development ecosystems.

I‚Äôm particularly excited about opportunities that allow me to continue learning and growing, while contributing to impactful projects that challenge conventional thinking. I am confident that my combination of technical skills, eagerness to learn, and commitment to quality make me a strong fit for your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team and would be glad to provide any further information. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,  
**Vitor Braga**
